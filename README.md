# Twemoji assets renamed
## Twemoji assets renamed to use Discord's emoji shortcodes.
I made this so i can use Discord emojis easily and in an organized folder.

How to use: download the zip thing in releases

### Dev stuff:

Build with `npm run run`

Clear `assets-renamed` folder with `npm run clear`

Building will give you a ton of errors, 99% are just because twemoji is missing some emojis from the emojibase database.

`Old` is old crap
