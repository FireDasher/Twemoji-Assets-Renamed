# Twemoji assets renamed
## Twemoji assets renamed to use Discord's emoji shortcodes.
I made this so i can use Discord emojis easily and in an organized folder.

How to use: download the zip thing in releases

### Dev stuff:

Build with `npm run run`

Clear `assets-renamed` folder with `npm run clear`

Building will give you 8 errors, they are just because even jdecked's twemoji is missing some emojis from the emojibase database, but these emojis are even missing from discord, so just ignore it. Also somehow 30 emojis are missing from assets-renamed, ignore that too.

`Old` is old crap
